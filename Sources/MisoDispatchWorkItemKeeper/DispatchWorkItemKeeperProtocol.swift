    /// Stops the keeper. This is done automatically when the `DispatchWorkItemKeeper` gets deleted.
    ///
    /// Depending on the `cancelAtStop` preference, the pending operations might get cancelled, and never get executed.
    /// This cancellation is there by default, as if your caller actually disappears, it is thought you do not wish
    /// for the operation to complete. That might lead to leaks, freezes or other unforeseen consequences if you were
    /// actually expecting a result.
    ///
    /// In this case, it's recommended you ask for the system to finalize its operations first, instead of
    /// cancelling them.
    ///
    /// - warning: The `stop()` operation will wait for the current tasks to be done. It will never "kill" a task.
    /// Thus, if you have acvery lengthy operation in progress, you might stall here, and potentially break
    /// system-mandated contracts to terminate in a short delay.
    ///
    /// - note: This operation is counted, you must do the same quantity of `stop()` than `start()` to stop the keeper.

    ///  - cancel: Override for cancellation
